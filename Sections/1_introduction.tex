\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Android's open-source nature and vast app ecosystem have contributed to its widespread adoption. For regulating access to sensitive user data, Android employs a permission framework that serves as a gatekeeper~\cite{alkindi2019android}. When using an app, the Android permission framework allows the user to either grant or deny permission for each type of data individually. Unfortunately, the study by Wagner et al.~\cite{ha2013android} reveals that only 17\% of Android users pay attention to permissions while installing/using an app. Once a user grants permission to an app, the permission framework allows unrestricted access to sensitive data endangering the user's privacy~\cite{alkindi2019android}. If the user does pay attention to privacy concerns and denies a permission request, the app often blocks access to not only the features related to the permission but also other features that may not require that permission~\cite{alkindi2019android}. This leaves the user with no alternative but to provide access to their data.

To enhance user privacy without limiting the app's functionality, users could be equipped with another option: feeding user-controlled, spoofed data to apps. Figure~\ref{fig:intro_case_study_uber} shows such a case study. In Figure~\ref{fig:intro_case_study_uber}a, we observe that even though the user wants to take the cab from the pinned location, Uber encourages the user to share their original location compromising their privacy. Figure~\ref{fig:intro_case_study_uber}b demonstrates how the user can hide their original location and feed the user-specified spoofed location as the current location. This safeguards the user's privacy while still enabling them to utilize Uber's service of finding a cab.

Unfortunately, existing approaches for spoofing the user data involve either modifying the Android OS~\cite{smalley2013security, raval2016you, wu2017context} or rebuilding the target app binary~\cite{backes2015boxify, jeon2012dr}, which have severe limitations in terms of usability and practicality. Modifying the OS requires rooting the device which is not practical for users~\cite{zhang2015android}. Rebuilding app binary is not always successful as it can be easily detected by using Google's Play Integrity API, making the app prevent users from accessing its services~\cite{andPlayIntAPI}. 

To equip users with a practical tool for preserving their privacy, we have built \textit{\framework{}}, a comprehensive and robust user data spoofing system that can spoof any user data fed to an app installed on a typical non-rooted Android device. Our evaluation results indicate that \framework{} robustly spoofs 78.32\% of the requested permissions by 70 popular pre-installed and user-installed Android apps without getting detected by the target apps and without crashing them.

We further show that the deception capability of \framework{} can be utilized to bypass continuous authentication mechanisms. Researchers have been developing a wide range of continuous user authentication mechanisms that rely upon device sensor data (e.g., accelerometer)~\cite{kolokas2019gait, sun2018artificial, thang2012gait, hoang2013adaptive, shih2015flick, nohara2016personal, lu2015safeguard, jain2015exploring, nixon2016slowmo, feng2014tips, abuhamad2020autosen, amini2018deepauth, li2018using, yan2018towards, song2016eyeveri, xia2018motionhacker, hong2016mgra, hong2015waving, miguel2016interaction, zhang2016voicelive, wang2019voicepop, johnson2013secure, khamis2016gazetouchpass, zhu2013sensec, sitova2015hmog, pang2019mineauth, acien2019multilock, zhu2019riskcog, lee2017implicit}. Unlike traditional one-time authentication mechanisms using passwords, a continuous authentication mechanism operates discreetly in the background, constantly monitoring user behavior and biometric features to validate their identity throughout their interaction with an app. Towards that end, to the best of our knowledge, \framework{} is the first system to demonstrate the ineffectiveness of the sensor data-based continuous authentication mechanisms in Android platforms.

We show that \framework{} proves to be successful in detecting malicious behaviors of and protecting user's private information from malicious apps that have been recently banned by Google. For example, while experimenting with the ``All Good PDF Scanner" Android app, \framework{} detected that the app was uploading user's private files to the internet. \framework{} blocked internet access of the app without crashing or limiting features of the app.

We also demonstrate \framework{}'s potential to detect and mitigate side-channel attacks by malicious apps. For example, our experiments reveal a significant drop in the mobile screen touch position prediction capability of a side-channel attack launched by a malicious app from 81.22\% to just 5.36\% when \framework{} is employed. 

The usage of \framework{} extends beyond protection against malicious apps. We use three real-world apps as case studies to show how \framework{} gives better control over privacy to users. For example, our study of real-world apps uncovers Facebook app recording user's audio while the user is just scrolling over the posts on the home page of Facebook app. This behaviour was not informed to the user by the Android privacy indicator (green dot) but it was detected by \framework{}. \framework{} could spoof audio to protect user's privacy. 

A demonstration video of employing \framework{} for user data spoofing on the Facebook app is available on \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiGUoqFLmk}{Youtube}\footnote{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiGUoqFLmk}. Table \ref{tab:highlights} highlights various usages of \framework{} with examples.

We validate that spoofing sensitive user data using \framework{} introduces only a minimal average overhead of 2.52\% in battery drain and 5.2 MB of memory during app runs. Each spoofed API call adds an average of 1.64 ms of overhead which did not add any noticeable performance degradation in the apps that we tested.

Overall, we make the following key contributions.
