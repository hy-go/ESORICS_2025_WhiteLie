Several past works~\cite{bokhorst2017xprivacy,bokhorst2021xprivacylua,hornyack2011these,ratazzi2019pinpoint,raval2019permissions,shrestha2016slogger} block or filter the user data to protect user's privacy. However, by spoofing the data instead of outright blocking or filtering it, provides users with greater control over their data without crashing the app.

Many approaches~\cite{backes2015boxify,jeon2012dr,raval2016you,smalley2013security,wu2017context} modify the Android OS or third-party app source code to deceive user data fed into apps. However, source code modification is detectable in modern Android OS making the tactic ineffective. In contrast, \framework{} eliminates the need for any modifications to the Android OS or third-party app source code.

Other approaches focus on improving the Android Permission Framework by offering intent of permission usage by the third-party apps ~\cite{chitkara2017does,tsai2017turtle,conti2011crepe,thanigaivelan2018codra}, momentarily revoking app permissions based on user-defined policies~\cite{bugiel2013flexible,liu2016follow,chakraborty2014ipshield}, app activities~\cite{zhang2015leave,chen2013contextual,chen2017sweetdroid,petracca2015audroid}, or machine learning algorithms~\cite{olejnik2017smarper,rashidi2016android,wijesekera2017feasibility,fu2017inspired}. Revoking permissions from Android apps comes at the cost of app crashes or limited app functionalities. Incorporating context-based policies, and machine learning algorithms to analyze app behaviour by generated logs with spoofing user data to ensure a seamless user experience and enhanced user privacy in \framework{} is an important future work.
