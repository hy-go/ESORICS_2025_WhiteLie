         \textbf{Use Case} & \textbf{Example(s)}\\
         \hline
         Bypassing Continuous Authentication & 
         \textbf{MGRA}~\cite{hong2016mgra} (Sec \ref{sec:continuous_authentication_mechanisms}) uses accelerometer data and \textbf{VoiceLive}~\cite{zhang2016voicelive} (Sec \ref{sec:continuous_authentication_mechanisms}) relies on the two different microphones to authenticate users. But \framework{} proves to be capable of bypassing these authentication mechanisms by spoofing the input data. \\
         \hline
         Granting Selective User Data & 
         \textbf{Snapchat}(\hyperref[sec:sc_case_study]{Sec 5.3}) and \textbf{Truecaller}(\hyperref[sec:tc_case_study]{Sec 5.4}) require access to private data like Contacts and Messages for their functionality, but this compromises user privacy. \framework{} allows users to grant only partial data, preserving privacy while still enabling app features. \\
         \hline
         Protection from Malicious Apps & 
         \textbf{All Good PDF Scanner} (Sec \ref{sec:malicious_apps}) had Storage and Camera permissions but was detected uploading data in the background, leading \framework{} to block its internet access. \textbf{Unique Keyboard} (Sec \ref{sec:malicious_apps}) accessed sensor data while running in the background, so \framework{} provided spoofed data during its background activity.
         \\
         \hline
         Side-Channel Attack Mitigation & 
         \textbf{Gyrosec}~\cite{lin2019motion} (Sec \ref{sec:side_channel_attack}) records the sensor data while running in the background, and uploads it over the internet. This was mitigated by deceiving the sensor data received by the apps.  \\
         \hline
         Unexpected Sensor Usage Detection & 
         \textbf{Facebook} (Sec \ref{sec:fb_case_study}) requested for Audio permission. But it was found (using \framework{}) to be recording the microphone data when no activity requiring microphone was being used by the user.\\
         \hline
         User Privacy Protection & 
         \textbf{Snapchat} (Sec \ref{sec:sc_case_study}) and \textbf{Truecaller} (Sec \ref{sec:tc_case_study}) provide great features to users but at the cost of sharing private information like Location, Contacts and Messages. \framework{} enables users to enjoy the provided features without compromising private information.\\
